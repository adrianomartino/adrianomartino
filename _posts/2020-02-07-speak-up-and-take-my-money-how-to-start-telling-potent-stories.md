There are many ways to tell a story, so how should we do it?

By now, we should all clearly understand that video is one of the most potent ways to entertain, connect, and engage an audience.

If you are still on the fence on the importance of video: Netflix anybody?

If you are still on the fence on the importance of entertaining an audience: Netflix anybody?

So let's ask ourselves,

What is working today?

Videos

In which fashion?

Stories

Are these stories of perfection?

No

Are these stories without challenges?

No

Would you have kept watching Friends if Ross and Rachel were cuddling around all day with no hiccups in their relationship?

Would you have watched Seinfeld if George Constanza had a perfect life, and Kramer politely pre-announced his visits?

Would you watch Law & Order if everybody was, in fact, obeying law and order? Not even a parking ticket?

Are the most-watched shows and movies relatable?

Yes. They connect either with our realities or with our fantasies.

Do they portray perfect people with perfect lives?

No

  
So why do business videos fail to entertain?

  
Because, when we are "talking business," we tend to take all of the best aspects of entertainment, plus our personality, and smash them to the ground.

  
It might sound simple, but many of us tend to kill all of the entertaining parts when it's time to record a video for our company, brand, or product. Why? Because it's safe. Even when during creative meetings, people mention the most exciting and valuable ideas, those rarely make it in.

  
Then, when our workday ends, we can all finally go home, put our feet up, and watch <fill in the blank entertaining show> because we need a break from our work environment. We need a distraction from "real life."

But what if our work could be more entertaining? What if when we went home, we didn't feel that change in register, but just a continuation of our day?

If you tend to work only on what you are passionate about and with people you align with, you are halfway there. However, there's still a TON of progress that we can all do as a society.

So, what can we do to make our work more satisfying?

We can start by making our audience's day better.

If we like stories that entertain us, what makes us think that our audience, our customers, our prospects aren't seeking the same things?

  
Even in a B2B environment, it's true that hard numbers are significant. Still, in the end, we all buy because of a feeling, an emotion, a belief. Only after, we justify our investment with logic.

  
So what else is holding us up?

What else do we need to finally find the courage to do something different and not to underestimate the power of entertainment?

  
I've seen a few things work as a final kick in the pants for some companies:

  
Trigger #1. Your competitor is doing it, so it's time to get on the train.

  
Trigger #2. Your engagement is so low that it's either drinking or drowning, as you are risking to shut down your business.

  
But what if you don't want to follow, but rather lead?

  
What if you don't want to wait for a breaking point before maximizing the way you entertain and connect with your audience?

  
**How can you trigger this behavior within your organization and get buy-in?** By testing on a smaller scale and get quick wins.

  
So try something different today. If you are working on any marketing material, B2B presentation, or any medium that talks about your company, products, team, opportunities, try to use an engaging story.

  
By engaging, I mean learn-from-the-TV-shows-we-watch engaging.

  
Make it human, make it relatable, talk about challenges, talk about mistakes.

  
Everybody can relate to making mistakes. We all make them every day.

  
What's relevant to your audience is not to know that you are perfect or that you didn't find any challenges. What's important to them is how you reacted to them.

  
Use video if you can, and please don't make it perfect. Don't make your story challenge-less. Don't try to be too accurate, either. There is nothing more annoying than accuracy.

  
I know it might feel awkward at first, but try first a few small changes on something of low stakes. Test. Experiment. Get comfortable. Then try some more on something slightly more consequential every day.

  
The low-stakes tests will teach you what works and what doesn't so that later on, you can use your learnings to impact some of the most consequential outcomes.

  
So, are you ready to start implementing change and finally jump on the entertainment train? Please understand that traditional advertising is dying slowly. Right now, it's all about the size and quality of your audience. There is not enough money in the world that can buy your way into engaging somebody else's audience unless you are, in fact, entertaining, relatable, and honest. And there is no better audience than your own.

  
So what are you waiting for? Are you ready to make your personality shine? Are you prepared to have your voice heard? If you are passionate about what you do, you will know what's right. You can feel it in your guts! But also, test first.

  
Start with something today and let me know in the comments what you came up with.

  
Peace!
