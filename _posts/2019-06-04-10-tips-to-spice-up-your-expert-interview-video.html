<p>"Expert" videos and interviews can get pretty boring. Why?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are many reasons why your expert videos are not engaging, including:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>People don't want to be lectured</li>    
  <li>Experts don't always come across natural on camera</li> 
  <li>Your message is too complex</li>
  <li>Your message is uninteresting or not relatable to your viewers</li>
  <li>Your message got to your viewer at the wrong time</li> 
</ol>
<p>So, how can you produce quality content, that is also engaging and moves the needle in the right direction?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a few tips:</p>

<h3>Before hitting the record button</h3>

<h4>#1 Don't script the expert</h4>
<p>There are two things there are paramount for an expert to be engaging during a video interview:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instill confidence</li>
  <li>Instill excitement</li>
</ul>
<p>When your expert will try to talk off a script, none of those two things will happen. <em>&ndash;Unless your expert is an expert at acting, or hosting TV shows.</em></p>

<p>If your expert is a master at her field, give her an outline, then let her speak freely.</p>

<p>Speaking freely about what she knows will make her feel more confident. When your expert sounds confident she comes across as knowledgeable. When she sounds excited, she comes across as approachable. The more knowledge she sounds, the longer her viewers will stick around. The more engaging she sounds, the longer her viewers will be eager to wait for her next drop of knowledge.</p>

<h4>#2 Set the tone to cater the viewer, not the production set.</h4>
<p>Wether you're dealing with a pro or a first-time interviewee, make sure you set the right tone for your video. Break the ice. Start a conversation. Most experts walk into a video interview feeling like they need to keep a certain tone, in line with the set. In reality their tone of voice needs to cater the environment and point of view of who's watching. Have a conversation with your expert. Let her understand and visualize who is going to watch this video and what's your viewer's context.</p>

<h3>During your interview</h3>
<h4>#3 Take the expert to her happy place</h4>
<p>If who you are interviewing is a true expert, she is passionate about her field and raves about her mission. Ask her how she got started. What moves her? Why does she wake up every morning? It's amazing what you can discover, and the invaluable soundbites you can get.</p>

<h4>#4 Ask relatable questions</h4>
<p>Instead of looking to produce a big pile of jargon, ask the expert &nbsp;questions like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is [fill in the blanks - field of expertise]?</li>
  <li>Why is [field of expertise] important?</li>
  <li>What's the most amazing thing you discovered lately?
    <ol>
      <li>Or what is the most amazing thing few people know?</li>
      <li>Or what is the main misconception about [field of expertise]?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>How does this apply to my daily life?</li>
  <li>If you could give one piece of advice to somebody that is in [blank] condition and is considering [blank]. What would you tell them?</li>
</ol>
<h4>#5 Ask dumb questions</h4>
<p>The reason why we need to interview an expert or watch an expert video, is because we are not experts. If we considered ourselves experts in that field, we wouldn't be watching this video. Unless in very specific circumstances, experts are not the audience for expert videos. So, it's important than the interviewer doesn't act as an expert. When I perform expert interviews, I ask questions from a beginner's mind perspective. It's amazing what you can untap when you ask the most basic things at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>#6 Ask deeper questions but look for simpler answers</h4>
<p>An expert who is passionate about her trade, will naturally use too much jargon here and there. Let her finish and try to understand what she means. Then use your understanding to reformulate a question that will get a simpler answer.</p>

<h4>#7 Ask for examples, anecdotes, jaw-dropping statements</h4>
<p>Experts are always reading the latest news in their field. Up to date with the latest researches and discoveries. These facts are great opportunities to get soundbites with jaw-dropping problem statements.</p>

<h4>#8 Make real life examples (ask for anecdotes)</h4>
<p>What you are talking about; how does it apply to me?</p>
<p>How does this apply to your audience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When editing</h3>
<h4>#9 Start with a staggering fact</h4>
<p>The jaw-dropping statements we mentioned? Look for them and pick the one with the best delivery. Remember, the viewer is scrolling, navigating, in an active state. The average viewers will only grant you a few seconds before deciding if you are worth 2 minutes of their life. Using a staggering fact at the beginning of your video will definitely help you keep them hooked. The more you hook them in the beginning, the longer your video can be.</p>

<h4>#10 Leave out anything that is there just for your own interest</h4>
<p>Viewers are choosing to give you their time. It takes one swipe to scroll down, one notification to tune out. Skip the intro logos and the long lower thirds. Instead, <em>show</em> your viewers that you are amazing, without telling them. If you offer real value, they will be compelled to find out more about you, read about your company, and get in touch.</p>

<h4>#11 Break it down</h4>
<p>As a rule of thumb, each video you put out should have 1 concept, 1 idea, 1 main thing for your viewers to learn, keep, act upon. In an expert interview is normal to give different examples and talk about many things. Take advantage of the variety of information you have. Only instead of trying to cram one video with it, break it into smaller chunks of content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will give you an opportunity to:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create shorter, easy-to-understand videos</li>
  <li>Leverage the power of Micro-Moments</li>
  <li>Target more specific audiences with your videos</li>
  <li>Increase the number of keywords and hashtags you will use to attract new audience</li>
  <li>Make each video more easily shareable because of its specificity</li>
</ol>

<p>And you? How do you produce your expert videos for your organization?</p>
