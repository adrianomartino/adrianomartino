Let's make a video! Will we?

There are many elements you need to consider when producing video content.

### **What are your options when it comes to producing video?**

Today, you have plenty of options, and you can produce video content with any budget.

### **Is the amount of money spent in video proportioned to success?**

NO. Nowadays, You can produce engaging content with no budget. You can also produce disengaging content while spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.

### **How do you determine how much money is worth spending into your video content?**

Let’s examine the following 2 opposite economic scenarios:

### **The Splurger**

In this scenario, you hire a big production company at early stages.

Not having tested with other videos before, you don't know what works in your case yet. When facing a decision you are not sure about, you make your choice based on the highest quality. When your budget is at cap you are forced to pick the least expensive option. This is not an ideal situation. The ideal situation sees you creating requirements based on your goals. The only justifiable instance for this approach is when you are in a time-jam. When timing is more valuable than the budget you would save.

### **The Do-It-Yourselfer**

In this scenario, you decide not to spend any “money” in video production. You don't hire an agency or consultant. You don't add the overhead expense of an in-house video communications specialist. You try to create video content by using your internal resources. Each team member uses her knowledge and resources to “make video happen”. Turn on a phone, watch a tutorial or two on good lighting and sound. Edit the video, using whatever software she has at hand. There's a lot of value with this approach: team building, no-cost experimenting. There are also a lot of drawbacks. Depending on your go-to-market strategy, this could be a temporary option to consider. If longer timeframes are not an option and your team is busy, this is not the ideal solution for you.

#### **Both of these approaches involve risks. Which one do you choose?**

  
The risks of The Splurger approach are:

* Spend money on fancy features, while not sure about the cost/reward ratio.
* Overlook at critical details that could use more budget and attention.

  
Can you guess what are the risks of the DIY approach?

There are 5 major risks that are not hard-money related, but that are as critical:

* Long time gap between idea/need and execution. Losing momentum due to the learning curve
* Unclear timing/distribution plan–video assets sitting on a shelf, losing value
* Too much time spent–opportunity cost in the specialty areas of the people involved
* Producing content that doesn’t move any needles
* Producing content that moves the needle in the wrong direction

Video is the best way to show humanity, empathy, and connect with your audience at a deeper level, and at a scale.

This is not only achieved through content selection. The non-verbal communication in a video plays a critical role. Execution, editing, colors, tone of voice, artistic choices, music, they all matter.

These areas are critical, and go beyond a technically acceptable video. Executing on those must be met with undivided attention, and by a creative marketer.

  
Which brings me to the third approach:

### **The informed decision-maker**

The informed decision-maker needs effective video content and understands its value. She decides to add a flexible investment into her video production process.

This approach will help you:

* Better understand video production
* Make more informed decisions
* Consider different creative solutions for each goal you set
* Get your team excited about content production
* Test video content before producing it at scale
* Understand where to save money
* Understand when it's important to go the extra mile

This method involves hiring an on-demand video communications consultant.

Hiring a video marketer will give you a competitive advantage. It will be like having an industry insider by your side.

This specialist could operate in one of the following ways:

• Independent one-man band that can handle shoots for testing and at a smaller scale

• Owner of a company with a scalable team for larger productions

• Free-range consultant who connects you with the best production agencies. She helps you manage projects and optimize budgets.

Ideally, this consultant owns the technical and creative knowledge to produce effective videos.

I find this approach to be effective in the following scenarios:

* Your company's success is determined by the effectiveness of your videos.
* You have a budget for video, but you want every dollar to count.
* You have tried other solutions in the past, without getting the desired results.
* You are ready to invest in video but want to feel empowered when making important decisions.

### **The takeaway**

* The 3 approaches I described above, are just a few of the options you have, but they are enough to give you some context.
* There's not a number I can give you for "how much is too much money". Video production costs vary by project. You can produce videos for $1,000,000, for $2,500, and for $0. You should choose your budget based on your specific goals.
* Saving money on video, doesn't mean saving money.
* Splurging on video doesn't always mean better results.

> Video is the best way to connect to your audience at scale.  
> Approach it smartly and you will succeed.

I hope this helps.
