## Hey there! You are not here by chance.

<blockquote>Good branding doesn't exist without good video. Good video content doesn't happen without a brand strategy.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Over the past 12+ years I spent the first 6 years working on the creative direction of entire projects. In 2012 I made the strategic decision to focus on video productions for brands.</p>

<p>Before shifting my focus towards video I used to work on:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Naming</li>

  <li>Logos and Designs</li>

  <li>Tone of voice</li>

  <li>Brand positioning</li>

  <li>Distribution strategies</li>

  <li>Print and digital design</li>

  <li>Photography</li>

  <li>Copywriting</li>

  <li>Art direction</li>

  <li>Engagement strategies</li>

</ul>

<p>My commercial filmmaking experience includes:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Research &amp; Discovery</li>

  <li>Screenwriting</li>

  <li>Casting</li>

  <li>Creative Direction</li>

  <li>Direction</li>

  <li>Direction of Photography</li>

  <li>Filming and Interviewing</li>

  <li>Coaching non-actors</li>

  <li>Selecting and directing music</li>

  <li>Video Editing</li>

  <li>Color Correction and Color Grading</li>

  <li>Compositing</li>

</ul>

Over the years I had the opportunity to work in a variety of industries including:

* Entertainment
* Smart home
